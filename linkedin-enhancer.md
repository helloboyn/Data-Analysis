### Assesment 5 
# Multi-Modal Content Enhancement

Task: Create a service that generates supporting visuals and key points for LinkedIn articles.

Specific Requirements:

1. Use managed AI services for both text and image generation
2. Implement a pipeline that:
  * Analyzes an article draft
  * Extracts 3-5 key points suitable for visual highlighting
  * Generates image prompts aligned with the content
  * Creates supporting visuals using an image generation API
3. Ensure visual consistency with professional healthcare aesthetic
4. Include text overlay options for key statistics or quotes

Deliverables:

* Working service that generates supporting content elements
* Documentation of the extraction and generation approach
* Sample outputs for a provided article
* Brief explanation of how this enhances engagement potential

Evaluation Focus: Multi-modal AI integration, content enhancement, visual communication

### Solution

Okay, acknowledging the strict 25-line limit means the code *cannot* implement the full service with live AI calls and image processing. It will simulate the core logic and data flow.

### 1. GitHub Repository & Code (Simulation)

**GitHub Repository:**

Please create a public GitHub repository (e.g., `linkedin-enhancer-sim`) and add the following `enhancer_sim.py` file.

**`enhancer_sim.py` (Under 25 Lines):**

```python
import json

def simulate_linkedin_enhancement(article_text):
    """
    Simulates the LinkedIn Content Enhancer pipeline.
    Uses placeholder data instead of calling managed AI services.
    Focus: Demonstrate data flow & multi-modal output structure.
    """
    print(f"Simulating enhancement for article snippet...")

    # --- Placeholder AI Service Outputs (Simulated) ---
    analysis = {
        "key_points": [
            {"text": "AI boosts radiology accuracy by 15%.", "overlay": "15% Accuracy Boost"},
            {"text": "Reduces report time by 25%, aiding efficiency.", "overlay": "25% Faster Reports"},
            {"text": "Trust & validation are key for AI adoption.", "overlay": None}
        ],
        "prompts": [
            "Clean professional healthcare tech graphic, AI assisting doctor, blue/white, 1:1",
            "Abstract data speed visualization, clock/medical icon, green/blue, 1:1",
            "Symbolic image of trust/security in healthcare AI, shield/hands, muted blue, 1:1"
        ],
        "image_urls_base": [f"https://sim.ai/img{i+1}_base.png" for i in range(3)],
        "image_urls_overlay": [f"https://sim.ai/img{i+1}_overlay.png" for i in range(2)] # Overlay only for first 2
    }
    # --- End Simulation ---

    results = []
    for i, kp in enumerate(analysis["key_points"]):
        overlay_url = None
        if kp["overlay"] and i < len(analysis["image_urls_overlay"]):
             overlay_url = analysis["image_urls_overlay"][i]
        results.append({
            "key_point": kp, "image_prompt": analysis["prompts"][i],
            "image_base": analysis["image_urls_base"][i], "image_overlay": overlay_url
        })

    return json.dumps({"enhanced_content": results}, indent=2)

# Example Call
sample_text = "AI in radiology improves accuracy..."
print(simulate_linkedin_enhancement(sample_text))
```

### 2. Loom Video Explanation

**(You will need to record this Loom video yourself)**

*   **Loom Video Link:** `[Insert Your Loom Video Link Here]`

*   **Video Script Outline (Concise):**
    1.  **(0-10s) Intro:** "Hi, this video explains the Python script simulating the LinkedIn Multi-Modal Content Enhancer. Due to the 25-line limit, this code uses placeholders instead of live Azure AI calls."
    2.  **(10-25s) Goal Recap:** "The goal is to take article text, simulate extracting key points, generating image prompts adhering to a healthcare aesthetic, and providing URLs for base images and images with text overlays."
    3.  **(25-60s) Code Walkthrough:**
        *   "The `simulate_linkedin_enhancement` function takes article text (though it's not used deeply in this sim)."
        *   "This `analysis` dictionary simulates the output from AI: extracted `key_points` with potential `overlay` text, corresponding `prompts` for DALL-E 3 (note the healthcare aesthetic keywords), and placeholder image `urls`."
        *   "The code then loops through the key points..."
        *   "...and builds a `results` list, packaging each key point with its prompt and simulated image URLs (including the conditional logic for overlay images)."
        *   "Finally, it returns the structured results as JSON."
    4.  **(60-75s) Example Output:** (Briefly show the printed JSON output) "This JSON represents the final deliverable: structured content elements ready to be used to enhance a LinkedIn post â€“ pairing text highlights with relevant visual concepts."
    5.  **(75-90s) Conclusion:** "This simulation demonstrates the core data flow and multi-modal integration concept. A full implementation would replace the placeholders with actual calls to Azure OpenAI for text analysis and DALL-E 3 for image generation. Thanks!"
